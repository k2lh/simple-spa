simple-spa
==========

Prototype-demo built with angular for FAQ/forum/support issues. Nothing that fancy, mostly working off (dummy) API 
calls to populate otherwise static pages. Since it was a demo, it really only needed to show enough to give 
decision-makers an idea of the general flow. It didn't have to be fleshed all the way out, but it's a basic 
angular spa architecture.
